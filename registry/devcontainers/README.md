# Dev Containers

This directory contains development container configurations that provide consistent, reproducible development environments using Docker containers. These configurations enable you to develop inside containers with all necessary tools and dependencies pre-installed.

## What You'll Find Here

Development container configurations including:

- **Language-specific containers**: Pre-configured environments for Python, Node.js, Java, .NET, and more
- **Framework templates**: Containers optimized for specific frameworks like React, Angular, Django, or Spring Boot
- **Full-stack environments**: Multi-service containers with databases, caches, and supporting services
- **Tool-specific setups**: Containers with specialized development tools and utilities
- **Multi-stage configurations**: Complex development environments with build pipelines and testing frameworks

## How Dev Containers Work

Dev containers use a `devcontainer.json` file to define:

- Base Docker image or Dockerfile
- VS Code extensions to install automatically
- Port forwarding configuration
- Environment variables and secrets
- Post-creation commands and setup scripts
- Development tool configurations

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Same environment across all team members and CI/CD systems
- **Isolation**: Keep project dependencies separate from your local machine
- **Onboarding**: New team members can start developing immediately
- **Experimentation**: Try new tools and frameworks without affecting your system
- **Reproducibility**: Guarantee the same development environment anywhere

## Usage

1. Copy the appropriate devcontainer configuration to your project's `.devcontainer/` directory
2. Open your project in VS Code
3. VS Code will detect the configuration and offer to reopen in a container
4. The container will be built with all necessary tools and extensions installed
5. Develop as normal with full VS Code functionality inside the container

Each configuration is tested and optimized for specific development scenarios and can be customized for your project's unique requirements.

# MCP Settings

This directory contains Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configurations that extend VS Code's AI capabilities by connecting to external tools, databases, APIs, and services. These configurations enable advanced AI-powered development workflows.

## What You'll Find Here

MCP server configurations including:

- **Database connectors**: Configurations for connecting to databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- **API integrations**: Settings for external APIs and web services
- **Development tools**: Configurations for build tools, testing frameworks, and deployment services
- **Documentation systems**: Connections to documentation platforms and knowledge bases
- **Cloud service integrations**: Configurations for AWS, Azure, GCP, and other cloud providers
- **Custom tool configurations**: Settings for domain-specific tools and internal services

## How MCP Works

MCP servers provide AI models with standardized access to:

- **Tools**: Executable functions that can perform specific tasks
- **Resources**: Data sources like files, databases, or API endpoints
- **Prompts**: Pre-configured prompts for common operations

## Configuration Types

MCP configurations support different connection methods:

- **stdio**: Direct process communication for local tools
- **HTTP**: RESTful API connections for web services
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication for interactive services

## Usage

1. Copy the appropriate MCP configuration to your workspace's `.vscode/mcp.json` file
2. Configure environment variables and authentication as needed
3. Enable MCP support in VS Code settings
4. Use the configured tools in Copilot Chat's agent mode

## Benefits

- **Extended capabilities**: Access external tools and data sources through AI chat
- **Automation**: Automate complex workflows involving multiple systems
- **Context awareness**: Provide AI with real-time access to project-specific data
- **Tool integration**: Seamlessly integrate existing tools into your development workflow
- **Standardization**: Use consistent interfaces across different tools and services

## Security Considerations

MCP servers can execute code and access external resources. Only use configurations from trusted sources and review all settings before enabling them. Use environment variables for sensitive information like API keys and passwords.

Each MCP configuration includes documentation about the tools it provides, required authentication, and usage examples.
